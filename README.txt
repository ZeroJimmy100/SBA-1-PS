The project is called create your own monster. The navbar will change depending on which link/url you are on, furthermore, if you were to click on "Create Monster" your previous monster will be deleted. How it is doing this, is by saving your inputs into session storage and the data within session storage will be display if you go on the link/url "View Monster". The only proper check validation it will check is the name, by making sure there's no special characters. However, the other validation it will check is if there is at least an image that you upload exist and making sure you pick a gender for your monster.
